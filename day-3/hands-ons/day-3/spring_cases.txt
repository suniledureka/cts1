 interface DataProvider
         int[] getData();

class DataProvider1 implements DataProvider
  return new int[]{45,25,63,12,8,62};

class DataProvider2 implements DataProvider
  return new int[]{-45,-25,-63,-12,-8,-62};

class DataProvider3 implements DataProvider
  return new int[]{5,8,4,6,9,2,1};


class BusinessLogic
 int findMax()
   -- based on DataProvider1/DataProvider2/DataProvider3 data
